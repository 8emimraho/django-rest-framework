# Final Nights 3: Nightmares Awaken - A FNaF Fangame with a Twist
 
Final Nights 3: Nightmares Awaken is a point-and-click survival horror game made in Unreal Engine 4 by JeliLiam. It is the third and final game in the Final Nights series, and follows the Bite of '87 from Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
 
In this game, you play as a patient who has lost his frontal lobe in a tragic accident. You are haunted by nightmares of Reaper Animatronics, twisted versions of the original animatronics from Fredbear's Family Diner. You have to survive five nights in a hospital ward, using a flashlight and other items to fend off the Reapers. You can also choose to sleep in your bed for a certain amount of time, but be careful, as your nightmares might become more intense.

The gameplay of Final Nights 3 is divided into two modes: Nightmares and Hospital. In Nightmares mode, you have to survive five nights in your own dreams, where you face different Reaper Animatronics each night. You can use a flashlight to check your surroundings, but be careful, as it has limited battery and can attract some Reapers. You can also use other items, such as a music box, a plushie, or a phone, to distract or repel some Reapers. You can also sleep in your bed for a certain amount of time, which will make the night go faster, but also make the Reapers more aggressive.
 
In Hospital mode, you have to explore the hospital ward and find clues about your identity and what happened to you. You can interact with various objects and characters, and trigger cutscenes that reveal more of the story. You can also find hidden minigames that show the events of the past. However, you are not alone in the hospital, as some Reapers might follow you there. You have to avoid them or hide from them, as they can kill you instantly.
 
Final Nights 3 has multiple endings, depending on your choices and actions throughout the game. Some endings are good, some are bad, and some are secret. Can you find them all?

Final Nights 3 has received positive feedback from many players and reviewers, who praised its graphics, story, atmosphere, and voice acting.
